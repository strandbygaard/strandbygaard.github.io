For as long as I can remember, Goretex has been king of water proof, breathable garments. Two events recently lead me to re-evaluate the validity of that: The Goretex pattent has actually expired, and I was in the market for a new hunting jacket.

If you're a hardcore gear-freak, you're thinking that I-know-nothing and that Goretex has long since been surpassed in all aspects by [eVent](http://www.eventfabrics.com/). While that is true, the one aspect where eVent never surpassed Goretex was that of actual availability of garments using it, and so for all intents Goretex has so fare reigned supreme.
