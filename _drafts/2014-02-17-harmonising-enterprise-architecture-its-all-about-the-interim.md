I stumbled across a post by [Brian Burke](http://www.gartner.com/AnalystBiography?authorId=26081) from [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com) called
[US Federal CIO Faces a Daunting Challenge](http://blogs.gartner.com/brian_burke/2009/03/11/us-federal-cio-faces-a-daunting-challenge/), in which he points out that many government-wide enterprise architecture programs have failed because underestimated political, cultural, and financial challenges. 

Though not explicitly stated in the post, one can then assume this is the challenge facing the US federal CIO, and the post then states the classical argument that _they are given the responsibility to optimise ... without the authority to get it done_.

Most anyone who's had to implement change in a big organisation, have at some point wished they had the authority to just command what needed getting done, and sure, given a stick big enough, change can be forced upon an organisation - but the end result is not very good and it causes as lot of dissatisfaction. If empowerment was the universal solution to the challenges facing the US CIO, then it would be an easy fix.

I always wonder why so many focus so much on the actual end result of a big enterprise architecture project. What about filling the interim? That is where most of the operating time is spent, and that is where the messy realities are. And, how many _big enterprise architecture projects_ have actually realised what they set out to do, anyway? (do note, that doesn't mean they don't realise anything)

True, if you _harmonise enterprise architecture_ in a loosely bound group of organisations, this impact will affect some more than others, but that does not imply that there must be winners and losers. Taking a note from economics, a [Pareto efficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) solution can be sought so that no one party will worse of after the change. 

This can also be viewed as addressing the political challenges of a project: Say to someone you're going to change their life, and they are going to be worse off afterwards, and they won't like it. On the other hand, if they're going to be better of afterwards, they are much more likely to agree.

If a change is just Pareto efficient, the end result only needs to be on par, but because people are [predictably irrational](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational). Specifically, they people tend to value higher what they have, also referred to as the _The High Price of Ownership_ or [endowment effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect.)
 
He doesn't state what the challenge is

Forgets the point about what to do with the interim

Harmonising is one thing, but how to get there is the difficult part

Federate to pull together values from different infrastructures
