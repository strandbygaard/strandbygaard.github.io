Geotagging is becomming more mainstream as alluded to by a [long article on News.com](http://news.com.com/Snapshots+that+do+more+than+bore+friends/2100-1038_3-6189892.html)

Of course 17 million geotagged images on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) in just a brief period of time goes a long way to show the interest, but it’s more interesting to follow the increasing mainstream interest in geotagging, as that will really get the camera manufacturers to churn out more GPS enabled cameras.

[Google Trends](http://trends.google.com/) is a great indicator of mainstream interest/trends, and searching for “geotagging” shows a peculiar development in interest that is however also quite common, for new “hot topics” which is a suddon dramatic increase followed be an almost immediate and severe decline (much like the Digg effect on a single web site).

The graph shows the relative development in searches on Google, and says nothing about the actual number of searches.Any ideas on what initiated the spike
