It wasn’t much of a surprise, but Google has [officially announced](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/were-expecting.html) that they’ll be adding a slide application called Google Presentations to their suite of office.

[Google Docs & Spreadsheets](http://docs.google.com/) are wonderful tools and a slide addition is great news. If only they would announce a significant speed improvement (mainly client side JavaScript), and (full) Safari support, though I’m sure the latter is coming now that Apple has announced that Safari is running on Windows.
