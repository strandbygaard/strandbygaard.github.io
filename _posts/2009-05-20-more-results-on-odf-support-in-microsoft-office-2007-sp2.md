The [ODF Alliance](http://www.odfalliance.org/) just published an [excellent gap analysis (PDF)](http://www.odfalliance.org/resources/fact-sheet-Microsoft-ODF-support.pdf%0A) on the (non-) support of ODF in Microsoft Office 2007 SP2.

Their findings seem to be fully in line with the conclusions Rob Weir arrived at in [his comparison](http://www.robweir.com/blog/2009/05/update-on-odf-spreadsheet.html)

From a marketing perspective the broken support for ODF introduced by Microsoft Office 2007 SP2 so far seems to working very well to Microsoft's advantage. They have received all the expected positive press coverage of their announced ODF support, and no mainstream news sites seem to be picking up on the incorrections.
