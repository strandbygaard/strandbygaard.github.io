Very good and much needed work by Yahoo! [http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2008/10/open_id_research.html](http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2008/10/open_id_research.html)

From a usability perpsective, it shows what many already know.. OpenID does have a long way to go before being ready for really mainstream adoption. Users are used to usernames and passwords, and unlearning that will take time and effort.

It looks like Yahoo! is realizing the potential of OpenID enabling there userbase. If you can capitalize on a significant userbase on your own site, why not send that same userbase to a different site, and capitalize on them there could be one line of thinking. It's good for Yahoo! because it generates (ad spnosered) cashflow and it's good for the users because they get the choice of using their Yahoo! account as identifier.
