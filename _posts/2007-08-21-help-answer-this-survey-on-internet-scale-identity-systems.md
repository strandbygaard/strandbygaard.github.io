I’m a big fan of surveys. Admitted, much can be said about the accuracy and truthfulness of individual answers, but I believe that a well written survey can serve to show a trend on a subject matter.

[Identity Woman](http://www.identitywoman.net/) is promoting a [survey](http://www.identitywoman.net/?p=633) on the future of Internet scale identity systems, and I’d recommend everyone with an opinion on the matter to spend a few minutes completing the [survey](http://www.identitywoman.net/?p=633).
