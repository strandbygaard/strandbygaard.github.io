It appears that the RTM version of Firefox v3.5 is available from the download servers, even though it is not officially announced.

Copy the download link for the English version of Firefox v3.5 RC3, and modify it to:
[http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.5&os=win&lang=en-US](http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.5&os=win&lang=en-US)
