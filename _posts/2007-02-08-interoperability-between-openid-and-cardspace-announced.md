Great news to all supporters of OpenID.

Today, at the opening keynote of the 2007 RSA conference, Bill Gates announced planned interoperability between CardSpace and OpenID, to be included in Longhorn.

OpenID and CardSpace satisfy two different use cases, and there really is a need for both approaches to the solution of federated identity. CardSpace promises a very intuitive and feature rich approach to federated identity management, addressing many of the existing problems of the defacto standard username/password based authentication.

OpenID, on the other hand is a much lighter technology requiring no client-side support, making it automatically supported on millions of mobile devices already out there, which likely will never have support
for CardSpace. Retrofitting existing web applications with OpenID is easier than adding CardSpace support.
