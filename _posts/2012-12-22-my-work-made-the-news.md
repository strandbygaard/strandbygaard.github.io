The Danish press has been writing a lot about the troubled POLSAG project.

Apparently, one news outlet managed to obtain public access to a report I wrote about the code quality in POLSAG, and published a [story](http://www.version2.dk/artikel/breaking-hemmelig-rapport-afsloerer-cscs-og-scanjours-katastrofale-polsag-kode-49583) about it.

They actually managed to read and report the contents fairly accurately :-)
